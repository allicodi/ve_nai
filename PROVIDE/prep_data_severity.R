# B) At least 365 days of study surveillance 
# C) No rotavirus diarrhea prior to week 18
# D) Wk18 and Wk53 plasma samples available (≥20µl)

# ^ this is what we used for asymptomatic data

# Per-protocol definition in severity paper says:
# "Secondary per-protocol (PP) analyses were performed including all children who had 365 days of
# follow-up and, if assigned to the vaccine arm, received both doses
# of rotavirus vaccine within the protocol-specified window."
